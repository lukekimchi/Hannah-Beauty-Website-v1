    q: "What kind of brow technique does Hannah Beauty use?",
    a: `
        At Hannah Beauty, we use an advanced technique called nano hairstroke and shading.
        What is nano hairstroke and shading?
        • Modern Technique: The nano hairstroke technique is a contemporary approach to eyebrow tattoos, done with a handheld tool, that combines precise nano hairstrokes with a soft shading effect to create natural-looking and defined eyebrows. 
        • High Technical Skill: Unlike traditional older tattoo methods, such as microblading, nano hairstroke requires even more advanced technical expertise and equipment.
        • Minimally Invasive: Applied gently, it prevents swelling and discomfort normally associated with tattooing procedures.
        • Pigments are designed to naturally fade over time allowing for adjustments to colour and shape as the client's natural features change. 
        `,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    q: "How is nano hairstroke and shading different to a brow tattoo?",
    a: `
        Nano hairstroke and shading is not in the deep layer of the skin, unlike tattooing, but more on the surface. It is also not permanent but rather semi-permanent. The colour will naturally fade which is a desired effect.
        `,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    q: "How is nano hairstroke and shading different to microblading?",
    a: `
      Nano hairstroke and shading is a much more modern technique, requiring a greater level of advanced technical expertise and equipment.\n
      A digital tattoo machine with a single, ultra-fine needle is used which allows for more precise control over the depth and speed of the needle, enabling the artist to create extremely fine and detailed hair strokes.
      Nano hair stroke technique often results in more realistic and finer hair strokes compared to microblading. The digital aspect allows for greater control, and the final appearance is generally more refined.\nNano hairstroke is also superior in that it is suitable for oily skin types whereas it makes microblading more difficult.

    q: "What are the benefits of nano hairstroke and shading?",
    a: `
    • Natural Look: Strives to produce the most authentic-looking eyebrows possible.
    • Versatile Use: Suitable across a wide range of eyebrow types, from thin to oily or dry, accommodating various skin conditions.
    • Ideal for Sensitive Skin Types: Perfect for people with oily, sensitive, or aging skin.
    • Quicker Healing: The recovery period is relatively short, typically around 5 days, lessening the interruption to everyday life. The aftercare process is a lot easier too.
    • Customizable: Offers a high degree of adjustability to meet individual preferences and needs.
    `,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    q: "How long does it last?",
    a: `
        The treatment is considered semi-permanent and will fade over time. This is desired to allow for adjustments to colour and shape as your natural features change. 
        Touch-ups are recommended every 1-2 years, but how often depends on a number of factors including:
        • Skin type (oily skin can result in faster fading)
        • Pigment colour used (lighter colours fade faster)
        • Sun exposure (can cause fading and discolouration)

    q: "What should I expect after my brows procedure?",
    a: `
        Immediately after the procedure, brows will look darker and bolder. This will last 3-4 days. 
        Do not panic! It is normal. After 7-10 days, around 30% of the colour will fade off giving your brows a more natural look.
        `,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    q: "How should I care for my brows after the procedure?",
    a: `
        At the end of your appointment, we will provide you with an aftercare cream to apply for the next 7-10 days immediately following your procedure. The details of aftercare are as follows:

        • Do not wash your brows. Water will draw the pigment out of the stroke.
        • Do not put your face into the shower stream.
        • Wash your face in front of a mirror to be sure you are avoiding the treatment area completely.
        • Do not pick, scratch any skin flakes or scabs. Allow them to fall off naturally.
        • Do not tint/dye/thread/wax the treated area.
        • Avoid any activity that causes heavy sweating.
        • No swimming for 3 weeks.
        • Apply a thin layer of repair cream that I offer or Vaseline 2 times a day.

    q: "What is SMP?",
    a: `
        Scalp micro-pigmentation (SMP) is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure that essentially gives an appearance of real hair follicles wherever you need it. By using very fine needles, pigment is dotted into the areas without hair, giving the appearance of fuller hair.

  },
  {
    id: 2,
    q: "Is SMP right for me?",
    a: `
        If you have scalp acne, very sensitive skin, and/or skin conditions like psoriasis, you shouldn't get SMP during a breakout or flare-up as it is difficult to apply pigment to inflamed areas. 
        If you are also prone to getting keloids we advise against getting SMP.

  {
    id: 3,
    q: "Does it hurt?",

        We try to make the SMP experience as comfortable as possible here at Hannah Beauty.
        Most people experience a light vibrating/prickling sensation which can be slightly uncomfortable depending on your pain tolerance. It is worth noting, however, that some clients fall asleep during SMP!

  {
    id: 4,
    q: "How long does it last?",
    a: `
        SMP is classed as a permanent treatment.
        Around 4 to 7, or more, years after your final treatment, you may notice slight fading of the pigmentation on your scalp (which is usually very minimal). 
        You may come in for a touch up treatment at this point.

  },
  {
    id: 5,
    q: "How long do I need in between each SMP session?",
    a: `
        At least 7 days is required between each treatment to allow the skin to naturally heal itself and pigment to settle.

  },
  {
    id: 6,
    q: "What should I do before SMP?",
    a: `
        • Take a good rest.
        • Avoid anything that might thin the blood (e.g. caffeine, aspirin, energy drinks, drugs, alcohol) on the morning of your treatment
        • Make sure you have washed and dried your hair before your appointment.
        • Come to your appointment free of any hair products (no gels, hairspray, powders, etc.)
        • Be careful to not get your scalp sunburnt.
        • Make sure your scalp is free of any redness, inflammation or breakouts before your appointment.
        • Don't dye or perm your hair at least one week before your appointment.

    id: 7,
    q: "How should I care for my scalp after the procedure?",
    a: `
        • After SMP, your scalp can get itchy. If so, apply a thin layer of the regenerating cream that we will give you.
        • You may wash your scalp with lukewarm water and shampoo the day after your treatment.
        • When washing your scalp be careful not to rub with your fingers too roughly - be gentle.
        • If you use a dryer, don't use hot air.
        • We advise you stay away from sunbathing, exfoliation and heavy sweating for roughly 1 month after the final treatment (e.g. no sauna, heavy exercise).
        • Avoid dying or perming your hair during the month after your final treatment.
        • If you start to get scabs on your scalp DO NOT pick at it.
        • After 1 month, you can return to all regular activities.
