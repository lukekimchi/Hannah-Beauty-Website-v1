      "Hannah taught me so many things during one on one eyebrow hairstroke & shading technique. It was very valuable time for me. Especially, it was a great experience for me to know what I have to fix and what is my weak points through on a real model. The training was so practical and beyond much much more than my expectations‚ò∫Ô∏è",

      "This is a long overdue review, I was the lucky first student at Hannah Beauty Academy and words can‚Äôt describe how grateful I am to have chosen to take this life-changing course with Hannah. She‚Äôs extremely talented and has amazing attention to details which is extremely valuable in teaching every step of the course. Hannah takes her time and could tolerate correcting errors over and over again with a big smile on her face. I can confidently say she‚Äôs the best teacher I‚Äôve ever had. Thank you Hannah ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
